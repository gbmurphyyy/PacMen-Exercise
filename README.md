# PacMenExercise

## Desciption of Project [How To Run]
The goal of this excercise is to have one or multiple PacMan roaming across your webpage at different speeds. This is achieved by firstly adding a PacMan to the screen, which is can created with the "Add PacMan" button. The PacMan will appear at random on the screen. Once you have the desired number of PacMen on the screen, it is time to have them move back and forth. This can be initiated by the "Start Game" button, which will then start the movements of the arbitrarily placed PacMen that were created and having them move at random speeds.
