# PacMenExercise

## Desciption of Project [How To Run]
The objective of this excercise is to have one or multiple PacMen roaming back and forth your webpage at different paces. This is achieved by firstly adding a PacMan to the screen, which is created with the "Add PacMan" button. The PacMan will then appear at random on the screen. Once you have the desired number of PacMen on the screen, it is time to have them move. This can be initiated by the "Start Game" button, which will then start the movements of the arbitrarily placed PacMen that were created and having them move at random speeds.
